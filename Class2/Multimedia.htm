        <h2>Accessiblity Concerns</h2>
        <p>Audio with spoken dialog should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately describe its content.
            Captions allow people who are experiencing hearing loss to understand an audio recording's content as the
            recording is being played, while transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review the
            recording's content at a pace and format that is comfortable for them. </p>

        <h2>Sample Video</h2>
        <p>Video uses a WebVTT ( Video Text Tracks ) file for Captions. Each item in a track file is called a cue. Each
            cue has a start time and end time separated by an arrow, with cue text in the line below.HTML and JSON can
            be used in cues</p>
